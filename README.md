# webscrape-template
a simple template for webscraping

## How to use 

This code is only a template. 

1. Fork and clone the repo. 
2. Install the necessary packages: 
- Selenium 
- Beautiful Soup 
3. You may need to run ```$ pip install webdriver-manager```
4. Insert a URL on line 10 and change the scraping function to suit the webpage you're scraping. 


## What is this? 

I do various webscraping projects and needed a template of some kind to use. This template works for me because Chromedriver sometimes does not have the right permissions on the computers I use. 

## Can I use this? 

Sure, though it is tailored to my workflow and environment. 

## Is that all? 

For this project, yes. After all, it's just a template so I can build other webscraping projects for various sites.
